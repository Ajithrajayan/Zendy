I had created two main test cases ('positivetestcase' and 'negativetestcase') to automate 'sign up', 'Login' and 'Home page search with selection of a document'.

## Libraries and Frameworks
* Selenium (v4.5.0) - Web automation
* Maven (v3.8.1) - Build and package management
* TestNG (v7.6.1) - Test execution and Reporting
* WebDriverManager (v5.3.0) - Selenium WebDriver management
* Java Faker (v1.0.2) - Generate fake data

## Programming Language
I'm using [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) version 17.0.3 and it works very well.
There are a couple of good reasons to use Java:
* It's been around for a while so there are a lot of solutions for most problems and if not then somebody from the community will be able to suggest an answer quickly.
* It's OpenSource - there are large, well supported communities sharing free libraries.
